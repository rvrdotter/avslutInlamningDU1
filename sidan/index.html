                    <p>Twin Fantasy began as a solo album released by Car Seat Headrest's lead singer/songwriter Will
                        Toledo on November 2, 2011. In an interview with CityBeat, Toledo explained that due to his lack
                        of resources, Twin Fantasy was unable to achieve the expansiveness he originally wanted, adding
                        that, "it just never seemed like the book was closed on it".</p>
